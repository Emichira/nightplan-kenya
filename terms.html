You agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent those prohibitions in any manner with regard to tickets you purchased. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not contact Party Kenya, Inc. to seek a refund or exchange from Night Plan Kenya, Inc. when Night Plan Kenya, Inc. is prohibited from providing one by its Organizers, and you will not dispute or otherwise seek a "chargeback" from the company whose credit card you used to book a table at the club or event. Should you do so, table preservation may be canceled, and Night Plan Kenya, Inc. may, in its sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future table bookings made from all credit card accounts or online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit all persons in whose name the credit card accounts exist and any person who accesses any associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches this provision from using the Site. Night Plan Kenya, Inc. typically only offers refunds and/or exchanges based on the Organizer’s instructions. Night Plan Kenya, Inc. is not obligated to issue a refund except to the extent that the Organizer responsible for bringing you the event (1) provides Night Plan Kenya, Inc. with the table booking funds necessary to issue refunds. In order to receive a refund or an exchange that may be offered, you will have to comply with the Organizer’s instructions or deadlines, which, along with the decision about whether or not to issue a refund or an exchange, may be at the Organizer’s discretion. If Night Plan Kenya, Inc. issues you a refund for a table bookings, it will issue a refund of the face value paid (or, if a discounted value, then instead the discounted value price paid). In no event will Fees or delivery prices or amounts be refunded under any circumstance. If a refund is issued, it will be issued using the same method of payment that was used to book the tables. If a credit card was used to make the refunded purchase, then only that actual credit card will receive the credit for the refund. In general, sales are final and Party Kneya Inc. and/or it’s Organizers will not issue refunds, unless the event is cancelled or rescheduled or the facility is closed due to unforeseen circumstances. If the event is canceled or rescheduled you may receive a refund or exchange based on the Organizers instructions. To request a refund you must contact Night Plan Kenya, Inc. with your table number, name, event name and contact info at nightplankenya@gmail.com. Again, under no circumstances is the service charge ever refunded even if an event is cancelled or rescheduled.
